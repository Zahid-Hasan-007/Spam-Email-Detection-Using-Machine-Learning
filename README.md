# Spam Email Detection Machine Learning Project

This project aims to build a machine learning model for detecting spam emails using the Logistic Regression algorithm.

## Introduction

Email spam, also known as junk email, is unsolicited messages sent in bulk by email. This project focuses on developing a model that can classify emails as spam or non-spam based on their content and other features.

## Dataset

The project uses a dataset containing labeled examples of spam and non-spam emails. The dataset is preprocessed to extract relevant features for training the model.

## Logistic Regression

Logistic Regression is a statistical method for analyzing a dataset in which there are one or more independent variables that determine an outcome. In this project, Logistic Regression is used to model the probability of an email being spam based on its features.

## Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
2. Run the `train.py` script to train the Logistic Regression model on the dataset.
3. Use the trained model to classify new emails as spam or non-spam using the `predict.py` script.

## Results

The model achieves an accuracy of X% on the test set, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting spam emails.

## Conclusion

The project demonstrates the use of Logistic Regression for spam email detection and provides a foundation for further research in this area.
